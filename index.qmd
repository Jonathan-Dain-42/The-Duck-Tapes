Welcome, I am so glad you are here!

Please feel free to take a look around. Blog posts about my research can be found under the "My Blog" tab. Check out the “About Me” page to get to know me. “Photos” has a collection of fun pictures from the beautiful places that “virus-hunting” has taken me. Finally, the “Extras” page has a collection of links and posts from other areas of my life some of which are non-research related.

Hope to see you around sometime and if you are in the Massachusetts area, I’d love to grab a coffee.
