    "text": "Yours truly holding a duckling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwabbing a duckling\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comedic line from the movie ‘Monty Python and the Holy Grail’ flashed in my head, as I pulled this beautiful male mallard from the clover leaf trap so it could be sampled and released again. We were back on Nantucket this past week to monitor the local waterfowl population for avian influenza, specifically highly pathogenic avian influenza. We had been watching a group of about 100 ducks swim in this small pond, Consue Springs, in the middle of this quaint Island town. Having set up the traps that morning it was a waiting game as the tide receded, exposing more of the corn ‘kibble’ in the center of these one way heart-shaped traps along the edge of the water. All the ducks had to do was swim into the trap for a tasty meal, and then of course donate a few swabs and some blood to science but the meal is the more attractive factor here.\nIt was already midday when the first MALL (the American Birding Association four-letter code for Mallards) finally wiggled his way into the gold mine of corn. Now our lab has this saying that ‘birds begat birds’ so we were going to let this individual encourage the others to swim into the trap with him. Pretty soon we had three more ducks swimming alongside him, so it was time to spring the trap. After some deft dip-netting and some iconic duck hand passes we had all four MALL’s inside our holding cage to begin processing.\nSo you might be wondering what ‘duck processing’ might consist of, well you came to the right blog to find out. Let’s zoom out a little bit first. Remember we are looking for avian influenza (AI) infections in these birds, virus hunting If you prefer.  AI infections are typically contained in the respiratory and GI tracts which means in order to see if these birds are actively shedding any live virus, we need samples from both ends of the bird. The business end i.e. the mouth and the ‘dirty’ end i.e. the cloaca. Bonus points if our new friends decide to use its handler as a restroom, we love a good fecal sample here. So yeah, we are taking oral and cloacal swabs to test for infection. But wait! There is more! We all just went through a global pandemic so probably the first thing you might think of when I say virus is SARS-COV-2, and the vaccine. Well, I also think of antibodies, which can be super helpful in telling us if this bird has had an infection to AI in the past since antibodies are specific to the infection they fight. Where do you get antibodies….that’s right blood samples and more specifically the serum fraction of blood. We also want a blood sample to look at gene expression but that will be its own post, for now, we are just taking a small blood sample to test for antibodies and expressed genes. Finally, we just take some simple morphometrics such as wing length, some beak measurements, and weight.\nAll in all, this takes about 10 to 15 minutes and then our feathered friend is back on the water to go eat some more tasty corn. The stunning male (or drake) MALL I pulled out of our trap did great and was back to swimming shortly. In total, we sampled ten adult ducks and two ducklings, which by the way are the cutest thing I have ever seen.\nIt is hard to explain the feeling of holding these magnificent animals knowing the weight of what you are doing. They are just so intricate and fascinating in their own right, their feathers for example are simply astonishing. This virus is truly a threat to the beauty of this world, it’s a privilege to be part of the solution. Until next time keep your eyes to the sky.\nCheers, Jonathan Dain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelba holding a MALL hen (female) while Connor and I dipnet the others\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team and I next to Melba’s beautiful sign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan can’t beat this view! Our two water clover-leaf traps worked great and gave us ideas to improve them."

    "text": "The City Nature Challenge is a fun worldwide collaborative bio-blitz with cities across the world to observe the most species (April 26 - April 29) and then ID them (April 30 - May 6)! We’ll be documenting urban biodiversity within the I-495 corridor, out to Stellwagen Bank, including Cape Cod and islands. It’s simple, it’s fun, and it contributes to scientific data helping to better understand our world and our non-human neighbors!\n.\nCopied from -&gt; https://www.bostoncnc.org/\n\nCitizen science is an amazing movement that is becoming increasingly more and more impactful as the years go by. Just look at the number of publications with the keyword “citizen science” over the years.\n\nYet how do we actually define citizen science?\nCitizen science is a very broad term that can have many nuances depending on who you talk with. However a very simple definition that I am quite fond of is as follows:\n\n“Citizen science broadly refers to the active engagement of the general public in scientific research tasks. Citizen science is a growing practice in which scientists and citizens collaborate to produce new knowledge for science and society.” (Vohland et al. 2021)\n\nI like this definition for two reasons:\n\nIt calls out the fact that there is a need to engage the public in research. Putting the task of “engaging” back on the scientist. In other words scientists need to be mindful of how they are engaging the community.\nIt speaks to the fact that there is a collaboration where both parties gain something, rather than a just a single researcher gaining new data for their project.\n\nSo now that we have a working definition of citizen science lets talk about the Boston City Nature Challenge! This past weekend there was a concentrated effort by scientists and the public alike to go out and catalog the biodiversity of the greater Boston area over the course of three days. As I am writing this there are currently 11,276 observations, representing 1,589 species (141 of which are birds in case you were curious). All of this was contributed by 1,227 observers. When you put this in context that this was just over the course of four days that is an amazing number of species seen. Especially since alot of these are not “professional” researchers going out to sample their focal taxa!\nBy the way 23 of those observations were mine :)\nThe best part of this is that you too can participate in something like this through the use of your own cellphone! You don’t need the fanciest piece of camera equipment to go and capture the local diversity. The tools to aid in the understanding of our natural world are in your hands, or at least they can be!\nIt is just the click of a few buttons to get the app here\nYou might be wondering at this point what I actually saw during this event right? Well I had the privilege to work with a group of other students to survey the Harbor Islands here in Boston for birds. We went out early in the morning last Friday in a boat around the islands. Part of our team was interested in the seal population, however I wanted to highlight the amazing avian biodiversity on these islands. In total we saw over 16 species of birds. Below are some of my photos, I hope that you enjoy them as much as I do.\n\n\n\nA Herring Gull\n\n\n\n\n\nA Common Eider\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother Common Eider\n\n\n\n\n\nAn American Oystercather in Flight\n\n\n\n\n\nSurf Scoters in Flight\n\n\nIf you want to see more pictures from the Boston City Nature challenge you can view them all here, which is the same link as above.\nIf you want to see more of my photos and citizen science you can see my eBird account and my iNaturalist account for more.\nI hope you have a fantastic day and as always keep your eyes to the sky!\nCheers, Jonathan Dain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nVohland, Katrin, Anne Land-Zandstra, Luigi Ceccaroni, Rob Lemmens, Josep Perelló, Marisa Ponti, Roeland Samson, and Katherin Wagenknecht, eds. 2021.

    "text": "Yours truly at the Boston Public Garden during Big Day Boston 2023\n\n\nI just moved to Boston last August and got into “Birding” as part of my Ph.D. at UMASS Boston studying Avian Influenza transmission. Since then I have been birding almost daily and increasing my understanding of the amazing world of Ornithology.\nI was really excited to see that there was a local birding event near where I was that was dedicated to the joyful task of seeing birds in your own backyard. It was an amazing day to have an event as well, given that the weather was just starting to turn and it was warm and sunny. To make it even more special I had just gotten an alert from Cornell that there was supposed to be a mass migration of birds(mostly passerines) in the days leading up to the event. All of this equated to one very happy #BirdNerd.\nAmanda (my wife) and I got there and met the hosts briefly before locking our eyes on the sky. They were incredibly nice people and even had a screen printing station with their custom logo! Their love for birds was on full display and it was an honor to be part of their inaugural birding event.\nAs for the reason for all our excitement………our feathery friends we saw so many wonderful species including my favorite bird the Common Loon (Gavia immer), who was in full breeding plumage and eating crabs in the wharf. Side note did you know loons have solid bones! Thats pretty wild for a bird that still has to fly relatively long distances! I walked away from this event with 24 total species, three of which were lifers (Black and White Warbler, Blue-Grey Gnatcatcher, and Common Tern), and better still a greater appreciation of Boston’s local avian biodiversity.\nHuge thank you for all the work that went into setting up this event and I can’t wait for next year. Here is a link to my eBird Trip report if you want to see all the species I saw. Until next time keep your eyes to the sky!\nCheers, Jonathan Dain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Field Guide and BigDayBoston Checklist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepping their screen printed shirt!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMomma Robin incubating some eggs"

    "title": "A New Year…",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A Great Black-Backed Gull from Appledore Island\n\n\nGood Morning Friends and Happy New Year!\nThe new year can bring with it a myriad of emotions, sometimes both positive and negative. Depending on where you are the new year can mean the start of winter or it can mean the start of a new exciting routine. Often though it just represents a new opportunity. My wife mentioned to me recently that she does not “get” the “new-year-new-me” trend because if someone wanted to change how they lived why not just start immediately rather than wait till the new year. It is an interesting “habit” that most of us have to make these new year’s changes, but I think it stems from this idea that when one calendar year closes another opens with an opportunity to make it different than the last.\nI started this new year with several goals in mind, one of them being to be more active on this blog for example. Now I use the term goal instead of resolution because I want it to be something that I am aiming towards, a new “identity” if you will. This would be opposed to a resolution that often feels very legalistic to me and seems to try to change the individual by focusing solely on the outcome rather than the driver of our actions. I want to be someone who writes, rather than making a rule over myself to write on some fixed schedule. It’s a slight difference but I maintain that inward change leads outward but not the inverse.\nNow this is a research blog so why am I talking about the new year and goals? Well, over the next several blog posts I will be outlining the major steps and ideas that are shaping how I am currently thinking about my research. It is my goal to do this for several reasons but the primary two are; one as I start writing my dissertation I will need to write anyway and this will allow me to write about my work in a much different style than scientific literature, and two I get to share it with you which is fun in and of itself.\nI hope that this new year is full of great opportunities for you to build better habits, change a mindset, write that paper, text that friend, or do any of the other things we as humans need to do. Most of all I hope you take the time to be intentional and seize the chance to change. There is no time like the present and as one of my best friends says, “The time will pass anyway whether I want it to or not so might as well make the most of it”.\nUntil next time keep your eyes to the sky\nCheers, Jonathan"

    "text": "Yours truly on Appledore Island, where Great Black-Back Gulls and Herring Gulls breed in massive numbers\n\n\nHello there my dear friends and welcome to the world of birds and their viruses\n\nInside the Lab:\nMy name is Jonathan Dain, and I am a Ph.D. student at UMASS Boston working in the VirusPlusLab led by Dr. Nichola Hill. We are a “Disease Ecology” lab focused on answering questions about the recent avian influenza outbreaks in wild birds. My personal interests lie at the intersection of the host virus dynamic. What are the ecological and phylogenetic drivers of avian influenza in the current North American outbreak? What can we learn from the host about infection with this virus in terms of the disease phenotype and immune response? What can we learn from the viral genomes about spread of the virus, host factors affecting spread and much more? Why do some bird species get infected with the virus and die very quickly while others are asymptomatic? How much does the host gene expression impact the spread of this virus into new areas and populations?\n\n\nOutside the Lab:\nApart from my studies at UMB, I am a fun-loving husband to Amanda Dain. I am an avid herpetologist and ornithologist and you will often find me with eyes to the sky, flipping logs, or waist-deep in a bog with frogs. As a lover of coffee, I am always down to pour a cup and sit at the table with a great book or have a deep conversation with a friend. I do my best to find beauty in the little moments in life and I have often said “wonder makes the common uncommon”. So come join me on this adventure with birds, viruses, coffee, and books and let’s see what wonders are ahead of us."
